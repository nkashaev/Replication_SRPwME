Data Sources
============

The paper uses two data sets:

-   Adams, A., Cherchye, L., De Rock, B., & Verriest, E. (2014). Replication data for: Consume Now or Later? Time Inconsistency, Collective Choice, and Revealed Preference (Version 1) [Data set]. ICPSR - Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research. <https://doi.org/10.3886/E112718V1>

-   Ahn, D., Choi, S., Gale, D., & Kariv, S. (2014). Estimating ambiguity aversion in a portfolio choice experiment. Quantitative Economics, 5(2), 195-223.[Replication files] <https://doi.org/10.3982/QE243>

Both data sets were transformed to csv format. The first data set was split into two tables. The first one contains information about single-individual households. The second one contains information about couples' households.

Software
========

First Application, Appendices B,E, and F
----------------------------------------

A version 1.1.1 of the `Julia` programming language was used in coding the analysis files. For details about how to install `Julia` on different platforms and make `Julia` programs executable from the command line see <https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/>. After installation of `Julia 1.1.1.` copy `ReplicationAK/Julia_envoronment/1.1.1/Manifest.toml` and `ReplicationAK/Julia_envoronment/1.1.1/Project.toml` files to `.julia/environments/v1.1`. Next run `using Pkg` and `Pkg.instantiate()` in the `Julia` terminal.

Second Application
------------------

Our second application (Section 8) requires the following software environment.

1.  Install `R 3.4.4`.

    -   Install `revealedPrefs` package from CRAN in `R 3.4.4.` (`install.packages(revealedPrefs)`).

    -   Unzip the `revealedPrefsmod.zip` package in `library` for your `R` installation (next to where the `revealedPrefs` was installed,e.g. `C:/Users/Elvis/Documents/R/R-3.4.4/library`).

    -   Alternatively, instead of the previous step, you can compile from the source `revealedPrefsmod.tar` file: `install.packages(revealedPrefsmod.tar,repos=NULL,type=source)`. This source file has the code for the functions that we use to simulate the draws of the true consumption and true price. These files have been written on the basis of the files in `revealedPrefs`. The files were modified under the terms of the GNU public license.

    -   Functions in `revealedPrefsmod.tar`:

        -   `simul.cpp`  -- It simulates prices and quantities from a uniform distribution good by good. Copyright 2014 Julien Boelaert.

        -   `simulprice.cpp`  -- modification of `SimGarp`. It takes prices as given and generates quantities.

        -   `simulpricewealth.cpp`  -- modification of `SimGarp`. It takes prices and expenditures and generates quantities that match them.

        -   `simulquantity.cpp`  -- modification of `SimGarp`. It takes quantities as given and generates prices.

        -   `simulquantitywealth.cpp`  -- modification of `SimGarp`. It takes quantities and prices as given and generates prices.

2.  Install `Julia 1.1.0`

    -   After installation of `Julia 1.1.0` copy `ReplicationAK/julia_environment/1.1.0/Manifest.toml` and `ReplicationAK/julia_environment/1.1.0/Project.toml` files to `.julia/environments/v1.1`. Next run `using Pkg` and `Pkg.instantiate()` in the `Julia` terminal.

    -   `Pkg.instantiate()` must be executed after all `R` packages are installed.

    -   The Julia package RCall may cause trouble in some systems with more than one `R` installation. Fix the `ENV[R_HOME]` to the desired folder in those cases. Additional details of this are provided in the main files of the second application.
